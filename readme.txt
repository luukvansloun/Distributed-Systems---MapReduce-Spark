This project is created using the following dependencies:
	- Python3
	- Pyspark version 3.0.0
	- Jupyter Core version 4.6.1
	- Jupyter Notebook version 6.0.2

If you have Python2 installed on your machine, it is recommended to use a Virtual Environment with Python3, to ensure this project runs as intended. To do so, setup a Virtual Environment within the project folder and enter it. Once you're in, simply run the command "pyspark", which will open your default browser with the Jupyter overview. There you can select one of the eight notebooks.

All used datafiles can be found in the "data" folder within this project.
